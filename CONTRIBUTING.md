CONTRIBUTING
============

Where to start
--------------

If you clone the repository don't forget to get submodules recursively.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajira86/docker-taiga.git --recursive
```

Else, you can get them later with the following command.

```bash
git submodule update --init --remote
```

If you want to run a simple local server, you can use docker-compose.

```bash
docker-compose up
```
